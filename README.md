# Dual-Reference Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Tumor Segmentation across Multiple Hospitals 🏥

We are excited to announce that our paper was accepted for publication at **IEEE TMI 2024**! 🥳🥳🥳

This repository contains the official implementation of our paper.

## Introduction 📑

This project introduces a new setting in medical image segmentation, termed **Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation (SFADA)**. SFADA aims to facilitate cross-center medical image segmentation while protecting data privacy and reducing the workload on medical professionals. By requiring only minimal labeling effort, SFADA achieves effective model transfer and results comparable to those of fully supervised approaches.

Visual comparison of traditional training and our Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation (SFADA) training. Our approach safeguards the source data while demanding only a minimal annotation effort.
