# Dual-Reference Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Tumor Segmentation across Multiple Hospitals 🏥

We are excited to announce that our paper was accepted for publication at **IEEE TMI 2024**! 🥳🥳🥳

This repository contains the official implementation of our paper. 
You can access the paper [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10553522).

## Introduction 📑

This project introduces a new setting in medical image segmentation, termed **Source-Free Active Domain Adaptation (SFADA)**. SFADA aims to facilitate cross-center medical image segmentation while protecting data privacy and reducing the workload on medical professionals. By requiring only minimal labeling effort, SFADA achieves effective model transfer and results comparable to those of fully supervised approaches.

## How to Run the Code 🛠

*We are currently preparing detailed instructions on how to set up and run the code. Please check back soon.*

## Dataset Information 📊
In the Discussion section of our paper, we mentioned our efforts to construct a relevant dataset. We are pleased to offer access to this dataset, which includes anonymized data from three centers: **Center A (50 cases)** 🏥, **Center B (50 cases)** 🏨, and **Center C (60 cases)** 🏬. We invite researchers working on **multi-center segmentation** and **GTV segmentation** to make use of this valuable resource. 

Please contact Hongqiu (hongqiuwang16@gmail.com) for the dataset. One step is needed to download the dataset: **1) Use your google email to apply for the download permission ([Goole Driven](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oc6l11BRmkLfVwHW_WnnYzG0Eu2AFsB-)). We will get back to you within three days, so please don't send them multiple times. We just handle the **real-name email** and **your email suffix must match your affiliation**. The email should contain the following information:

    Name/Homepage/Google Scholar: (Tell us who you are.)
    Primary Affiliation: (The name of your institution or university, etc.)
    Job Title: (E.g., Professor, Associate Professor, Ph.D., etc.)
    Affiliation Email: (the password will be sent to this email, we just reply to the email which is the end of "edu".)
